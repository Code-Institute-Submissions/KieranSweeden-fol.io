### Fixed

The following are bugs that I have dealt with & fixed.

#### (403) Forbidden CSRF Verification Failed

I encountered an issue when first logging into the Django admin console where it would present a 403 status code page, stating that the current URL did not match any of the trusted URL's.

After googling the issue, I found a couple of Stack Overflow answers that helped me understand the issue and what needed to be done in order to fix it. Those are listed here:

- https://stackoverflow.com/a/71194288/15607265

It seems that versions of Django that are 4 and above, require the <code>CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS</code> setting within settings.py.

Once I inserted this setting within my settings.py file with my respective URL, the bug was fixed.
