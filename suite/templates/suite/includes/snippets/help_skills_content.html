<p>A <strong>folio skill snippet</strong> represents an <strong>individual skill you posess</strong>. A skill snippet can <strong>only be one of two categories</strong>, the first being a <strong>tech skill</strong>, the last being a <strong>soft skill</strong>.</p>
<p>For each skill snippet, you can provide a <strong>title</strong> (being the name of the skill) and a <strong>description</strong> as to <strong>how you obtained that skill</strong>.</p>
<p>You can <strong>attach as many of these as you'd like</strong> to a folio, however it is of course <strong>recommended</strong> that you <strong>be selective and concise</strong> with what you put in front of a potential employer.</p>
