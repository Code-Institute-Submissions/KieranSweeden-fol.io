<p>A <strong>project snippet</strong> represents a project you would've made in the past. You can attach a <strong>picture</strong>, <strong>describe</strong> the project in depth and <strong>attach links</strong> so <strong>potential employers</strong> can check out your code/work.</p>
<p>Folios are all about being <strong>concise and to the point</strong> (which is <strong>in the interest</strong> of your <strong>potential employers</strong> of course). So with this in mind, <strong>a folio can only contain 4 project snippets</strong>, so choose your projects <strong>wisely</strong>!</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>We <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that you provide a picture that has an <strong>aspect ratio of 16:9</strong> (e.g., 1280x720, 1920x1080 etc.). Pictures with a different aspect ratio are <strong>very likely</strong> provide <strong>unfavourable results</strong>.</p>
<p class="small"><i>We will be looking to support various image aspect ratios in the future.</i></p>
