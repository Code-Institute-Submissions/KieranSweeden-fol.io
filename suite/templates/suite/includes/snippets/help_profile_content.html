<p>The <strong>suite</strong> is the place where you get to <strong>create, update, select, re-use & delete</strong> various folio snippets, which form the structure of your <strong>folio</strong>.</p>
<p>When interacting with the suite, it's important to <strong>view folio snippets (i.e., projects, skills etc.)</strong> and folios as <strong>independent entities</strong> that are <strong>only linked when you decide they should be</strong>.</p>
<p>This means that when you <strong>edit and update</strong> a folio snippet, the recent changes you would've made to that snippet will <strong>also appear in other folios</strong> that the snippet is linked to. Also if you <strong>delete</strong> a folio snippet, due to it's deletion, it will therefore <strong>not exist in other folios</strong> where it may have been <strong>linked to previously</strong> before it's deletion.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>After <strong>opening your first folio</strong> in the suite, fol.io will <strong>remember</strong> the last folio you recently viewed. So anytime you click the <strong>suite link</strong> in the top navigation bar, fol.io will open the <strong>latest folio</strong> you viewed.</p>
