<p>A <strong>folio profile</strong> is made up of <strong>selected "About Me" profile snippets</strong> alongside <strong>current project</strong> & <strong>future goal</strong> information (which can all be seen below).</p>
<p>The about me's are folio snippets as you may want to <strong>present different aspects</strong> of your background and <strong>re-use them</strong> in various folios to <strong>target various job description requirements</strong>. You can use as many of these as you like, however it's <strong>common best practise</strong> to keep your folios <strong>concise for potential employers</strong>.</p>
<p>This page is where a potential employer can see <strong>where you've been, where you're currently at</strong> and <strong>where you'd like to eventually be</strong>.</p>
