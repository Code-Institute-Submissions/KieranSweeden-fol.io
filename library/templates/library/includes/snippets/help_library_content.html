<p>The <strong>library</strong> is where you manage the <strong>creation</strong> of <strong>folios</strong>, <strong>editing</strong> their titles/descriptions, <strong>publishing/concealing</strong> them or <strong>deleting</strong> them entirely.</p>
<p>Folios are <strong>concealed by default when created</strong>. Assuming you have licenses available, you can publish a folio by clicking the <strong>Publish</strong> option within it's additional menu. Please be mindful that one license allows the publishment of one folio, which can later be swapped for another folio if you desire.</p>
<p>If you haven't bought any licenses yet, you can purchase some at the <a href="{% url 'purchase_license' %}">license store</a>.</p>
