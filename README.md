### Strategy

#### The Problem

It's well documented within the IT industry that it's becoming increasingly difficult for businesses to fill their IT positions with qualified personnel.

#### The Solutions

[This article](https://www.codingame.com/work/blog/find-developers/top-it-recruitment-challenges/) by Nathalie Figuière, which dissects these challenges utilizing survey data given from developers & current IT HR personnel, proposes a variety of solutions to help combat this. The first three solutions Figuière provides, are the ones that are relevant to this application, those being the:

- Removal of IT degree requirements
- Consideration of non-traditionally educated developers
- Broadening of searching for candidates

Despite degree's remaining a key requirement within most company recruitment processes, the removal of degree requirements is [becoming an increasingly more common stance](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html). However, as [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-hire-jobs-without-degree-experts-say-college-important-2020-10?r=US&IR=T) suggests, experts still say that a college degree remains the best bet in landing a well paid tech job.

The consideration of non-traditionally educated developers regards those who are self-taught, that learned their development skills from other forms of educational resources such as videos within YouTube or online courses hosted by Udemy etc. Figuière dives deeper within [this article](https://www.codingame.com/work/blog/tech-recruiting/why-you-should-hire-self-taught-developers/), presenting reasons why self-taught developers should be considered, some notable reasons being that self-taught developers are:

- Eagerly motivated given their education is driven by themselves.
- Likely more communicative as they're often integrating within online tech communities.
- Adaptable in taking on new tech, not relying on tech skills acquired in school.
- Natural problem solvers given they've likely learned from hitting roadblocks & chicanes during their learning.

The broadening of searching for candidates, suggests that businesses should employ multichannel recruitment strategies, utilizing online platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed or community events such as hackathons or coding contests.

A conflicting aspect to an application like this, is that developers are obviously able to create their own portfolio to highlight their work. One negative to this however, is that it takes a lot of time to create a portfolio and aspiring developers who are self-taught are likely to be working full-time, meaning they have limited time available. A platform that presents their talents & work whilst being quick & easy to update would be beneficial, as they can focus their efforts on producing side-applications that are of more interest to potential employers.

It's also common place to tailor a CV for a particular job, so that what the employer sees is relevant to the job specification. It's likely a self-taught developer will be applying to numerous vacancies and adjustments will need to be made in order to present themselves in their best light to the employer. [This post](https://jobhelp.campaign.gov.uk/right-for-the-role-5-ways-to-tailor-your-cv-to-the-job-description/) suggests the following are resume elements that should be changed per application to target particular vacancies:

- The introduction
- Keywords
- Employment history

#### The Objectives

Taking these points into consideration, the application should aim to:

- Highlight the strengths & skills of self-taught developers.
    - The content developers create regarding themselves should be front & center, acting as the focal point and the application itself should take a backseat when the content is being viewed from employers.
- Position itself stylistically alongside other alternative hiring sources.
    - The application should sport a UI that's familiar to these existing platforms, utilizing the conventions these platforms have created to make the application's UI easily learnable.
- Be a speedy & easy way for aspiring developers to update what they've previously done, what they're currently up to and their future goals.
    - The speedy nature requires as few clicks/actions as possible for the individual to achieve their respective goal with the application.
- Make the user's portfolio alterations simple and quick, saving them time and enabling them to apply for more vacancies.

#### The Audience

The target audience for this application are self-taught developers, who are likely participating in a career change whilst working full-time and would benefit from a quick and easy way to present their work and skills to potential employers.

Following B2C considerations, it's important that the application sports a simple, clean & modern brand look and targets their struggle with time management, being presented as a fast & effective solution to present their talents. The target audience is also likely in not justifying their purchasing decisions resulting in impulse buying, so the purchasing mechanism needs to be quick and easy.
