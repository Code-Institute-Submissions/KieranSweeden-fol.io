#### The Problem

It's well documented within the IT industry that it's becoming increasingly difficult for businesses to fill their IT positions with qualified personnel. [This article](https://www.codingame.com/work/blog/find-developers/top-it-recruitment-challenges/) by Nathalie Figuière, which dissects these challenges utilizing survey data given from developers & current IT HR personnel, proposes a variety of solutions to help combat this. The first three solutions Figuière provides, are the ones that are relevant to this project, those being the:

- Removal of IT degree requirements
- Consideration of non-traditionally educated developers
- Broadening of searching for candidates

Despite degree's remaining a key requirement within most company recruitment processes, the removal of degree requirements is [becoming an increasingly more common stance](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/16/15-companies-that-no-longer-require-employees-to-have-a-college-degree.html). However, as [this article](https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-google-hire-jobs-without-degree-experts-say-college-important-2020-10?r=US&IR=T) suggests, experts still say that a college degree remains the best bet in landing a well paid tech job.

The consideration of non-traditionally educated developers regards those who are self-taught, that learned their development skills from other forms of educational resources such as videos within YouTube or online courses hosted by Udemy etc. Figuière dives deeper within [this article](https://www.codingame.com/work/blog/tech-recruiting/why-you-should-hire-self-taught-developers/), presenting reasons why self-taught developers should be considered, some notable reasons being that self-taught developers are:

- Eagerly motivated given their education is driven by themselves.
- Likely more communicative as they're often integrating within online tech communities.
- Adaptable in taking on new tech, not relying on tech skills acquired in school.
- Natural problem solvers given they've likely learned from hitting roadblocks & chicanes during their learning.

The broadening of searching for candidates, suggests that businesses should employ multichannel recruitment strategies, utilizing online platforms such as LinkedIn, Indeed or community events such as hackathons or coding contests.

A conflicting aspect to a project like this, is that developers are obviously able to create their own portfolio to highlight their work. One negative to this however, is that it takes a lot of time to create a portfolio and aspiring developers who are self-taught are likely to be working full-time, meaning they have limited time available. A platform that presents their talents & work whilst being quick & easy to update would be beneficial, as they can focus their efforts on producing side-projects that are of more interest to potential employers.

Taking these points into consideration, the project should aim to:

- Highlight the strengths & skills of self-taught developers.
- Position itself stylistically alongside other alternative hiring sources.
- Be a speedy & easy way for aspiring tech folk to update what they've previously done, what they're currently up to and their future goals.
